This site was built with a JS framework called Gatsby. Gatsby uses React components and JSX, but unlike typical Create-React-Apps, it features server-side-rendering to pre-render html rather than download JS and then render it in the browser. This ensures very fast load times and allows search engines to index the site.

## Key skills

- GatsbyJS framework and plugins
- SSR (Server side rendering)
- SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheets)
- MDX (Markdown components)
- Hosting via Netlify
