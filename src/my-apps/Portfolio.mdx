This site was built with a JS framework called Gatsby. Gatsby uses React components and JSX, but unlike typical React apps, it features server-side-rendering to rapidly speed up loading times and improve search engine optimisation.

## Key skills

- GatsbyJS framework and plugins
- SSR (Server side rendering)
- SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheets)
- MDX (Markdown components)
- Hosting via Netlify
