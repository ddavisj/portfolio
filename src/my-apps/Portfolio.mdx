This site was built with a JS framework called Gatsby. Gatsby makes use of React components and JSX (JavaScript XML/markdown) but, unlike typical Create-React-Apps, it features server-side-rendering to pre-render html rather than render it in the browser. This ensures super quick load times and allows Google and other search engines to index the site.

## Key skills

- GatsbyJS
- SSR (Server side rendering)
- SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheets)
- MDX (Markdown components)
- Free hosting via Netlify
