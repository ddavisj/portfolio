It was built after completing a [React/Redux course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) and adapted from a video streaming app. Users can authenticate via Google and edit, update and delete books. A custom React component lets users search the Google Books
API and add books from a list of search results.

Book data is stored in a JSON file. Heroku's 24 hour server cycles means that new books added will be lost, please log in and add one.
