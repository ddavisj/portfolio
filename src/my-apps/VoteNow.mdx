Users log in using Google single-sign-on, add credit via Stripe and create a survey that is then sent to an email list. When email recipients then click a link in the email to vote, SendGrid sends a webhook to our Express server and the resulting click data is stored in MongoDB. This enables survey creators to monitor clicks.

This app was built as part of a [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development) course on a MERN stack.
