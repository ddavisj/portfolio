Users login using Google single-sign-on, add credit via Stripe and create a survey and verify its details before sending.
When recipients click to vote in emails, SendGrid sends webhooks to the Express server and click data is stored in MongoDB. This lets survey creators monitor clicks.

The app was built as part of a [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development) course on a MERN stack.
It also features integrations with APIs including Google OAuth2 and Stripe.
