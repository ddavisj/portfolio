# About

This portfolio was built with Gatsby JS, a React-based front-end framework that enables server side rendering for fast serving of data and content.

GraphQL is used to load SEO metadata and easily readable MDX files, ie. markdown, are used to store app descriptions.

The site is hosted on Netlify and uses their edge/content delivery network to cache and quickly serve content to users.
